# Sierpinski-Triangle-Simulation
Sierpinski Triangle is a simulation that shows an initial green cell with a nucleus (a small white circle) that in the next generation produces two similar daughter cells, one at its left, the other at its right. The daughter cells repeat this for another 20 or so generations, leading in the end to the structure of a Sierpinski triangle.
